## Installation

You'll need flutter SDK. I used the latest in 2024 March.
Also add ur own assets. (obviously) (6 images(jpg or jpeg), 2 videos(mp4))
The project is implemented static. there is no external data used, all info is stored in List<List<dynamic>>.
There is a video player dependency. run this:
  flutter pub add video_player
  #pubspec.yaml will update automatically


## Usage

setup Android studio or VS. make a new project and shove this all in project > lib.
dont forget the video_player from #Installations
make 'assets' folder in project directory.
in pubspec.yaml add the asset 
  - - assets/
Thats it. Just run it and hope for the best. If the gods of coding are happy with u u should see a running app.
